### The website

This website is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll], and uses a customized version of [Jekyll Minima][jekyll-minima] as theme.
The social media icons are powered by [Font Awesome 4][font-awesome].
<!--more-->

All pages are *free of any social media tracker*: No other javascript than my self-hosted [Matomo][matomo]'s are ever included.\\
Social media share links are just links. They have *no idea* you're reading one of my stories you click one of them!

### The content

I'm not a really "content productive guy". Writing software is something, and writting about it is something else!

I'll try to write at least one article blog a year, about computing, iOS, software security, IoT, audio, or anything I need to talk about at some point. Let's hope this diversity will have his audience.

Only the stories' content, and embedded code extracts are under [MIT License][mit] and may be reused.\\
The website code, design and logo may not be reused.
