### Me

Born near Paris, I've been a keen developer since my 11's ; and I've always loved understanding a bit more computer sciences and the development world in general. 
<!--more-->
But it's only when I started computing engineering in my school, [L'Ã©cole Centrale de Nantes][ecn], that I understood my pro life should be about computing as well.
Since then, I'm a security engineer, software architect, and code owner for [DiliTrust][dilitrust], and I work both for the web and iOS.

Beside, I like sound design & music, cinema, Parisian french way of life ; and my cat Newton.

### This blog

This blog is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll], and uses a customized version of [Jekyll Minima][jekyll-minima] as theme.

All pages are *free of any social media tracker*: No other javascript than my self-hosted [Matomo][matomo]'s are ever included.\\
Social media share links are just links. They have *no idea* you're reading one of my stories you click one of them!

The server is a VPS provided by [OVH][ovh] and is powered by [Debian][debian] and [Nginx][nginx].

### The stories

I'm not a really "content productive guy". Writing software is something, and writing about it is something else!

I'll try to write at least one story a year, about computing, iOS, software security, IoT, audio, or anything I need to talk about at some point.

Only the stories' content, and embedded code extracts are under [MIT License][mit] and may be reused.\\
The website code, design, logo, images or other content may not be reused.
