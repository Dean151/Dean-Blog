For the people who knew the blog before this update, it's completly gone.

### Why ?

Because I used Dotclear, and it didn't really fit my needs. Multilingual, too complex for my use, I decided to retire it.

Now I use [Jekyll][jekyll], and it's really great. It allow to generate a completely static website !

If you're interesseted by getting started with Jekyll, you can check [this blog][sylvain-blog] that have plenty of Jekyll related posts. A must see !

### Mais où est le Français ?

All the articles were in french, but from now on, I decided the main language of the blog will be english. 
Indeed, english is by far the main langage of programming articles over the web.
But it still think accessible french version of iOS related articles would be great on the web, that why I should work on multilingual version of my blog for french people soon !
