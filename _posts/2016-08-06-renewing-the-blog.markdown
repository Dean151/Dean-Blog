**Updated on Mar 16, 2019**

For the people who knew the blog from before 2016, it's completely gone.

## Why ?

Because I previously used Dotclear, and it didn't really fit my needs: it was too complex compared with my real needs.
Plus, there were an issue with the Dotclear's comment system, it was polluted by bots.
So I decided to retire it.

Now I use [Jekyll][jekyll], and it's really great. It allows to generate a completely static website !

If you're interested by getting started with Jekyll, you can check out [this blog][sylvain-blog] that have plenty of Jekyll related posts. A must see !

## *Mais où est le Français ?*

All the stories were in french, but from now on, I decided the main language of the blog will be english.

The main motivation is that there is not enough traffic for french articles, and english is the standard language for any developer.

It would have been nice to maintain a french version as a multilingual blog. I've tryed that, but it's already complicated to write stories, and translating them have becomen a bottleneck, so I've decided to stop.

## What kind of article will I find now on the blog?

It depends on what topic I want to abord, but it'll be mainly about computing and other software tweaks I've been into in my past. Web or iOS development, few tools I've tried like Pi.Hole, Homebridge... etc. Also I'll try to abord topic about security, IoT...

The only main lock for this blog is that I don't always have enough time or motivation to write. Don't expect an new story each week.
