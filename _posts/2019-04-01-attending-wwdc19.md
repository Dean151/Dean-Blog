(This is not an April fool!)

It's with great pleasure that I will attend this year [ WWDC][wwdc].\\
It'll be my first WWDC from the inside, and I'm super excited about it already!

## What to expect this year?

Of course we expect the annoucements of iOS 13, macOS 10.15, watchOS 6, tvOS 13, but here's a few features we can expects from those:

### Marzipan: from iOS to macOS

Announced at last year WWDC, the Marzipan project will allow UIKit apps to run on macOS. We can expect that the API should open this year to developers with macOS 10.15.

I can't wait for my first tests, trying to build [DiliTrust Exec][dilitrust-exec] for macOS will be one of the first things I'll attempt during the WWDC 19. 

### iOS 13 Dark Mode

A very [persistent rumor][dark-mode] would make the dark mode real with iOS 13. This would be a battery saver for OLED screen devices, and despite I'm not found of dark mode in general, I can understand that much people are waiting for this!

### Advanced iPad features

Bringing new iPads features and make it "MacBook" capable, this is one of [the rumors that I like the most][ipad-features].
Having multi-account abilities, more USB devices support (like USB drives), better multitasking... That would make the iPad more mature in the tablet market. 

## Will you write articles about the announcements?

I'll try to write few WWDC articles on the blog, but I'll do that with care. The [WWDC policy][wwdc-policy] is clear that I should not share screenshots nor write "public reviews". It's possible that I will not release anything before the end of the WWDC, and none of those post will contains samplecode from Apple, or screenshot whatsoever. 

## Attending too?

Don't hesitate to get in touch with me, using any of the available social networks in the page footer. It'll be a great pleasure to meet other passionate developers, and eventually go out for a drink at some point!

I see you there!
