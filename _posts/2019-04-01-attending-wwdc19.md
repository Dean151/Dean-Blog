(This is not an April fool!)

It's with great pleasure that I will attend this year  WWDC.\\
It'll be my first WWDC from the inside, and I'm super excited about it already!

## What to expect this year?

Of course we expect the annoucements of iOS 13, macOS 10.15, watchOS 6, tvOS 13, but here's a few features we can expects from those:

### Marzipan: from iOS to macOS

TODO

### iOS 13 Dark Mode

## Will you write article about the announcements?

I'll try to write few WWDC articles on the blog, but I'll do that with care. The WWDC policy is clear that I should not share screenshots nor write "public reviews". It's possible that I will not release anything before the end of the WWDC, and none of those post will contains samplecode from Apple, or screenshot whatsoever. 

## Attending too?

Don't hesitate to get in touch with me, using any of the available social networks in the page footer. It'll be a great pleasure to meet other passionate developers, and eventually go out for a drink at some point!

I see you there!
